* ~500 ml of lukewarm water (~40Â°C)
## Sauce Ingredients
* 3 Onions
* 3 garlic cloves
* 800g of good quality canned tomatoes (or better, when in-season, ~2kg of home-grown tomatoes)
* A pinch of salt
* A bit of balsamic vinegar
* A splash of red wine, or a bit of sugar
* Fresh cut oregano and basil

## Processing model
### Preparing the dough
Almost identical to [pita bread's similar steps](https://github.com/yoavweiss/recipes/blob/master/pita_bread.md#preparing-the-dough), with the following differences:
  * Mix together the flour and semolina as your base "flour"
  * A lot more olive oil! Try to add it before the salt, to avoid the mix becoming too wet
### Sauce
  * TODO
### Pizzas!
  * Take a clean surface to work the dough, and cover it in semolina
  * Cut a large fistful of dough from the mix (~ twice the size of a pita)
  * Flatten it with a rolling pin on the semolina surface. Add more semolina to prevent it from sticking
  * <wax paper> or <thin wood surface thing>
