# Pizza!!
## Ingredients (4-5 medium pizzas)
* 5g of dried yeast or 20g of fresh yeast
* 1 tablespoon of brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon of salt
* 9 tablespoons of olive oil
* 600g of T45/all purpose flour
* 150g of fine-grained semolina (and some more to work the dough later)
* X ml of lukewarm water (~40Â°C)

## Processing model
### Preparing the dough
Almost identical to [pita bread's similar steps](https://github.com/yoavweiss/recipes/blob/master/pita_bread.md#preparing-the-dough), with the following differences:
  * Mix together the flour and semolina as your base "flour"
  * A lot more olive oil! Try to add it before the salt, to avoid the mix becoming too wet
### Sauce
  * TODO
### Pizzas!
  * Take a clean surface to work the dough, and cover it in semolina
  * Cut a large fistful of dough from the mix (~ twice the size of a pita)
  * Flatten it with a rolling pin on the semolina surface. Add more semolina to prevent it from sticking
  * <wax paper> or <thin wood surface thing>
  * <add pictures>
