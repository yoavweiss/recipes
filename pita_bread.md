### Preparing the dough

2. Put the flour in a large bowl, add the yeast, and start adding water little by little, while kneading everything to a dough.

3. Once the ball of dough is a bit formed, dissipate the tablespoon of salt in some water and add it to the mix. Continue kneading.

4. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the mix and continue kneading. Add in more water as you go.

5. At some point, the mix feels too wet and you may think you got it wrong. Fear not!! Keep kneading until the mixture is smooth. Add more water as needed, once the mixture have dried out a bit.

2. Preheat your oven to 250°C, with a steel oven tray in it, placed in the upper part.

2. While there's dough in the bowl:

    1. Cut a fistful of dough and turn it into a ball.

    2. Flatten the ball using a rolling pin, until it's about ~0.5cm thick.

    3. Place it on a floured surface and let it rise for ~10 minutes.
