## Processing model

### Preparing the dough

1. Take the yeast, the tablespoon of sugar and a bit of water and mix them together in a glass. Give the yeast ~10 minutes to react & foam.

2. Put the flour in a large bowl, add the yeast, and start adding water little by little, while kneading everything to a dough.

3. Once your ball of dough is a bit formed, dissipate the tablespoon of salt in some water and add it to the mix. Continue kneading.

4. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the mix and continue kneading. Add in more water as you go.

5. At some point, the mix feels too wet and you may think you got it wrong. Keep kneading until the mixture is smooth. Add more water as needed.

6. Once the ball of dough is smooth, cover the bowl with th ball of dough in it with a wet cloth, and place it in a luke warm place for a couple of hours.

### Pitas!

1. Preheat your oven to 250°C, with a steel over tray in it, in the upper part of the oven.

2. While there's dough in the bowl:
    1. Cut a fistful of dough and turn it into a ball.

    2. Flatten the ball using a rolling pin, till it's about ~0.5cm thick.

    3. Place it on a floured surface and let it rise for ~10 minutes.

3. Once the oven is done preheating, switch it to grill mode.

4. Throw the pita bread in the oven, ~4 at a time, for ~5 minutes

5. You can take them out once they develop a slightly brown hue and an air pocket.
