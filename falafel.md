# Falafel
It's the bestest! This requires some planning ahead, as you'd need to soak the chickpeas in water the day before (36 hours, ideally).

## Ingredients
* 500g of chickpeas - soaked for 36 hours with water are double their volume, with 1 teaspoon of baking soda.
* 1 large onion.
* 4 garlic cloves.
* 1 bundle of parley.
* Bonus: 1 bundle of coriander.
* 1 teaspoon of paprika.
* 1.5 teaspoons of cumin.
* 2.5 teaspoons of sea salt.
* 0.5 a teaspoon of baking powder.

## Processing model
### Paste
* Chop up the onion and garlic, just to make sure they get minced.
* Same for the parsley and coriander.
* Put all the ingredients in a food processor, and chop it till is becomes a paste.
* Add a bit of water if needed.
### Falafels
* Form small round balls from the paste.
* Warm up sunflower oil (enough to cover the falafels) to ~180&deg;C (~350&deg;F)
* Fry the falafels for a couple of minutes, until they are brown nicely from the outside
* Dig the out and eat quickly after, while they're still warm.

## Tips
* Formed falafel balls can be frozen, so you can prepare a bunch and save them for a later occasion.
* If you like your falafels a bit spicy, you can add half a cayenne pepper to the mix above.
